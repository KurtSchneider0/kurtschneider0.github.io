It executes on terminal bootup and refreshing. It is written in bash. You can use it to customize your terminal in different ways.
Echo ascii text One of the simplest things you can do with .bashrc is to echo ascii text on bootup. For that you open .bashrc with your editor of choice, I&amp;rsquo;m using sudo vi ~/.</description></item><item><title>The geometric series and an application</title><link>https://kurtschneider0.github.io/posts/geometricseries/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Feb 2022 17:30:13 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://kurtschneider0.github.io/posts/geometricseries/</guid><description>Geometric Series I was doing a little work on the geometric series in class today, and then found a nice application for it in math club. The post summarizes it.
In math class I dealt with the two formulas $$\sum_{k=0}^{n}r^k=\frac{1-r^{n+1}}{1-r}$$ and $$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}r^k=\frac{1}{1-r},|r|&amp;lt;1.$$ The first can be proved by induction. The inductionstep looks like this. $$\sum_{k=0}^{n+1}r^k=\sum_{k=0}^{n}r^k + r^{n+1}=\frac{1-r^{n+1}}{1-r} + r^{n+1} = \frac{1-r^{n+1} + (1-q)r^{n+1}}{1-r} = \frac{1-r^{n+1} + r^{n+1} - r^{n+2}}{1-r} $$ $$= \frac{1 - r^{n+2}}{1-r}.</description></item><item><title>My internship at superluminar</title><link>https://kurtschneider0.github.io/posts/internship/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jan 2022 17:30:13 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://kurtschneider0.github.io/posts/internship/</guid><description>First day First meeting Becky and I first met at 8am to plan the rest of the day. I already had a lot of the programs I needed installed, so that part didn&amp;rsquo;t take long. The plan was for me to set up my own blog site using a framework called Hugo and summarize my first day as a blog. When I&amp;rsquo;m done with that, I could move on to React.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://kurtschneider0.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kurtschneider0.github.io/about/</guid><description>General I&amp;rsquo;m a student at Gymnasium Lerchenfeld I&amp;rsquo;m really interested in Mathematics, Physics and Computer Science I&amp;rsquo;m currently learning about Category theory, Topology and Quantum Theory Projects I collaborated on a paperfor the IMMC I&amp;rsquo;m writing a little blog Other small projects are just on my GitHub</description></item></channel></rss>
